# Overview

## History

The "O" language is not really new, it is rather a logical evolution step for APL-like languages. Along ideological lines "O" is a successor of K family (Arthur Whitney) of programming languages. Though, it doesnâ€™t share a single line of code with K5 and implemented in Rust instead of C.
O's development had been started in Dec 2016, and redesigned 5 times so far. Current design seems to be polished enough to be considered as 'stable'.
