# Symbols

Symbols are entities similar to those of Lisp.
They mostly server the same purpose - for referencing variable names and as keys in dictionaries.

They are defined by backticks followed an optional name.
Names can contain UTF8 letters, digits and dots.

```o
o) `a
`a
```

Symbol vectors:

```o
o) `a`b`c
`a`b`c
```
